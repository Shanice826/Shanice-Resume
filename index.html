 <h2>Summary
 </h2>
 <p>
    Passionate, analytical and driven web developer who enjoys creating beautiful and functional websites for clients, companies and as a side projects for fun! I am a full stack developer who started off with humble beginnings of learning the basics of HTML and CSS from crash courses online through ZTM to taking full courses through Udemy to gain new skills into a career path that I always wanted to be. In web development it brings out both of my strengths of assessing what needs to be done and how to make the website attractive, modern and user-friendly. My goals in web development is to become a senior full stack webdevloper in the next 10 to 15 years.
 </p>
 <p>
    My work background in business adminstration, content writing and customer relations helps my career path by bringing in soft skills of how to communicate with clients and company demands. I know how to actively listen to the needs of clients, be able to complete a project within the time frame, resolve contflicts and know how to showcase presentations to make an impression. These soft skills also helped me to be able to show empathy and concern for not just the clients and customers but, towards my coworkers as well. This in turn, allow the workflow to remain steady, efficient and create a positive work environment.
